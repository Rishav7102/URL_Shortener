# Url_shortner
This project only contain  backend part. I will update  frontend part later in it.
The Link Shortener is a web application that allows users to shorten long URLs to a shorter, more manageable length. This application then uses the shortened URL to redirect to the original long URL, view the number of clicks and the date/time of the last click for each shortened URL and view the list of URLs shortened till date.


I made this project using Nodejs, Expressjs, Mongodb.
Package required:-
Node_Module:-  npm init -y;
Expressjs :- npm i express
Mongodb :- npm i mongodb mongoose
Short id :- npm i shortid    // to generate short links unique id
I had used nodemon for live server :- npm i nodemon
and finally i used thundercast to cast it on mongodb
